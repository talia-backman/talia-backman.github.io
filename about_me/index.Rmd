# **ABOUT ME**{#top}
Hey, I'm Talia Backman.  I recently graduated from Utah Valley University with a Bachelor's in Biology.  I will be attending the University of Utah in the Fall to get my PhD in Molecular, Cellular, and Evolutionary Biology.  My future goals incude getting a postdoc and becoming a professor.
I was born and raised in Utah and hope to never leave.  It is a beautiful state and I love being outdoors.  My favorite hobbies include running, camping, hiking, skiing, and playing with my pup (his name is Ragnar and to say I love him is an UNDERSTATEMENT).
Thanks for visiting my github!

## **CV**
I will put my CV here eventually..
