#Your tasks:
#1. Do an analysis of the mtcars data set. That's right, our old friend mpg will be the dependent variable.
#2. Do your analysis in an Rmarkdown document, complete with explanations for what is going on, what models you are trying, and figures showing predicted vs real data, etc.
#3. Knit that Rmarkdown to an html file and add it to your website with a link that is easy for me to find on your page.
